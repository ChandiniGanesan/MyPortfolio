       <p align="justify">Description:
         Today we have lot of tools to perform data analysis, however it is essential in some 
         research projects that the researchers have their custom built tools to ease the access
         to their data and perform statistical analysis using data visualization. In this project,
         I have buil an web application using HTML and Python to allow users to upload a data.csv file
         with multiple features of historical Church dataset of the world(In video:Rome). 
         The user can feed in the combination of feature values that needs to be selected for the geospatial 
         visualization. The slider on top of the output indicates (variable) the centuries that appear in the
         given dataset. Plots that are in green color are the physical location of the churchs that originated
         in that particular century. The green plot indicated the mathematically calculated center of the churchs
         that were originated in that particular century.
