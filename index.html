                 Hi, I am a recent graduate student from NJIT. I have completed my M.S in Computer Science with GPA 3.6 and currently seeking for 
    career opportunities in Data Science. I am a passionate programmer with precise knowledge on Data Analytics. It is my ambition to 
                    become a expert Data Scientist and contribute to the real time problems of the world.</p>

         Today we have lot of tools to perform data analysis, however it is essential in some 
         research projects that the researchers have their custom built tools to ease the access
         to their data and perform statistical analysis using data visualization. In this project,
         I have buil an web application using HTML and Python to allow users to upload a data.csv file
         with multiple features of historical Church dataset of the world(In video:Rome). 
         The user can feed in the combination of feature values that needs to be selected for the geospatial 
         visualization. The slider on top of the output indicates (variable) the centuries that appear in the
         given dataset. Plots that are in green color are the physical location of the churchs that originated
         in that particular century. The green plot indicated the mathematically calculated center of the churchs
         that were originated in that particular century.        <br>

        <p> <h4>Libraries used:Javax.swing, BufferedReader, FileReader, Synthetica</h4> </p>
       <p align="justify">Description:<br>
         One of the most important and well known data mining concept that helps improve sales in a business is Market Basket Analysis.
         Apriori Algorithm plays a vital role in affinity analysis that discovers co-occurrence relationships among products.
         This software developed using Eclipse Java provides users the facility to feed the available purchase history of products and 
         obtain the results of apriori algorithm to understand how purchase of one product affects the other using a support and confidence 
         threshold. Support refers to how many times a combination of products have occurred and confidence is the conditional probability of 
         purchase of product B given purchase of product A.

       <p align="justify">Description:<br>
               Applying data science techniques to a large dataset enables us to predict targets whose values are unknown.
         I have performed data wrangling techniques like removing NaN values from data, normalizing the data, binning , creating dummies
         ,visualising linear relationship between variables, evaluating correlation and causation statics to perform data visualization to
         understand the important features that play a vital role in determining car prices. Model selection was made and Multiple Linear Regression
         has been applied to the dataset to predict the used car price.

         The testing helps to identify if adding a new feature to an existing website improves customer views or not. This type of analysis helps to decide if an investment to establish the
         component is necessary.
